## Usefull commands

## What I would change in my app

- I would improve the UI of some aspects, such as the inputs, selects, and pagination. I would also add a better loading animation and a better error page
- I would add the possibility to check the info that comes from the other endpoints given by the API (locations and episodes)

## Why I did what I did and why I didn't do some stuff

- I didn't add the option to sort the list as this is not supported by the API and I this is something that should never be done locally (since there's more than one page of results most of the time)
